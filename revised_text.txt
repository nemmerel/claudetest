Notes on Response to Referees

The year 2021 yielded $16.2 trillion in aggregate capital gains on assets held by households in the United States — 94% of net national income, and an amount larger than wages, dividends, or interest income . While 2021 returns were un-
usually large, economically signifcant gains have become increasingly common: over the past two decades, real asset appreciation averaged 20% of national income. 

Existing research has explained the rise in asset values by secular changes in earnings and profits, driven by monopoly rents, retained earnings, intangible investment, and a shift in income to the corporate sector. The rise in capital gains in turn has been linked to a number of macroeconomic phenomena: an increase in household leverage prior to the Great Recession in response to elevated housing values, an increase in spending and local employment in response to stock market returns, and an increase in aggregate wealth. Less is known, however, on who receives the gains. Measuring these gains is important not only to better understand their substantial aggregate effects on consumption, savings, and wealth, but to also to better understand how they affect measures of the distribution of income, wealth inequality, and optimal tax policy. We note that most measures of income inequality, including the DINAs, do not include capital gains as part of their income measure.

The goal of this paper is to estimate the distribution of capital gains at the individual level, and document how they are correlated across income, wealth, realized capital gains, demographics, and geography. We will then study how capital gains affect measures of income inequality, tax progressivity, and wealth inequality. 

We do so using internal tax data from 2002-2021. The advantage of tax data is its comprehensiveness, spanning the entire income and wealth distribution. The disadvantage is that only realized sales of assets directly show up on tax forms, which are only a small fraction of total appreciation (the sum of unrealized and realized). Prior research has found only about 1/3rd of the stock of capital gains have been realized.

To estimate realized and unrealized gains at the individual level, we use a three step procedure: (i) link individuals to their specific portfolio holdings (ii) capitalize income (using heterogenoeus capitalization factors when available) to estimate wealth (iii) estimate capital appreciation by multiplying wealth by asset class specific returns (using heterogeneous returns when available). In doing so, we exploit never before used tax forms, new data sources, and improved estimation techniques to provide the most accurate available measures of wealth and capital gains at the individual level. We highlight three innovations here: (i) we use techniques from the network economic literature to better track partnership wealth through network chains of ownership, which allows us to trace 90% of partnership assets to their ultimate owners (ii) we use never before used tax form to link 100% of rental real estate assets to their ultimate owner, which allows for a more accurate estimate of real estate wealth and capital gains (iii) we use a new data source on private business sales to better estimate business valuations and capital gains. 

We find that only a small fraction of aggregate capital gains have been realized:  As shown in Figure 1, from 1954-2021, less than 20% of aggregate capital gains accrued over this period were were reported on tax returns. We find that total capital gains are poorly proxied by tax realizations for three reasons: (i) a growing share of capital gains are in tax exempt accounts and thus not subject to tax (ii) individuals can delay selling assets, sometimes indefinitely (iii) capital gains reported to authorities are nominal, and combine income over many periods. The correlation of capital gains and realizations is XXX. 

[Effective tax rate] 
Demographically, capital gains are dominated by the relatively elderly; the average 65 year old has XXX in capital gains, compared with YYY for a 25 year old. As the population as a whole ages, so does the concentration of capital gains in the aged. Across geography, [states that have high KGs]. Their correlation with labor income, capital income, wealth, etc. 

The most striking fact about capital gains is their concentration. Capital gains are distributed highly unequally, and are the most concentrated form of income: the top 1% (by income) received 59% of capital gains over our sample period. By wealth, the top 1% received 90%. 

We estimate the distribution and concentration of comprehensive Haig-Simons income, which is inclusive of capital gains. Because capital gains are so concentrated, they substantially increase measures of inequality. Using a Haig- Simons income defnition, which includes asset appreciation, the top 1% (10%) of individuals received 21.0% (47.9%) of the income pie; their share without capital gains is 18% (45%). Capital gains on public and private equity are the main driver of the increased concentration, while housing and pension capital gains lead to a more equal distribution. The results are robust to alternative assumptions for cap rates and 

These results are robust to [].
