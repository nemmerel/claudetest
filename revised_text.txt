Notes on Response to Referees

The year 2021 yielded $16.2 trillion in aggregate capital gains on assets held by households in the United States — 94% of net national income, and an amount larger than wages, dividends, or interest income . While 2021 returns were un-
usually large, economically signifcant gains have become increasingly common: over the past two decades, real asset appreciation averaged 20% of national income. 

Existing research has explained the rise in asset values by secular changes in earnings and profits, driven by monopoly rents, retained earnings, intangible investment, and a shift in income to the corporate sector. The rise in capital gains in turn has been linked to a number of macroeconomic phenomena: an increase in household leverage prior to the Great Recession in response to elevated housing values, an increase in spending and local employment in response to stock market returns, and an increase in aggregate wealth. Less is known, however, on who receives the gains. 

The goal of this paper is to estimate the distribution of aggregate capital gains at the individual level, and explore how they are correlated across income, wealth, geography, and demographic groups. Measuring these gains is important not only to better understand their substantial aggregate effects on consumption, savings, and wealth, but to also to better understand how they affect individual wellbeing and the implications for tax progressivity. We note that most measures of the income distribution and tax progressivity, including the DINAs, do not include capital gains as part of their income measure. 

We do so using internal tax data from 2002-2021. The advantage of tax data is its comprehensiveness, spanning the entire income and wealth distribution. The disadvantage is that only realized sales of assets directly show up on tax forms, which are only a small fraction of total appreciation (the sum of unrealized and realized). To understand the relationship between realized and unrealized gains, we estimate aggregate gains using data from the Financial Accounts of the Federal Reserve, and combine these with our data from internal tax files. As shown in Figure 1, from 1954-2021, less than 20% of aggregate capital gains accrued over this period were were reported on tax returns. We find that total capital gains are poorly proxied by tax realizations for three reasons: (i) a growing share of capital gains are in tax exempt accounts and thus not subject to tax (ii) individuals can delay selling assets, sometimes indefinitely (iii) capital gains reported to authorities are nominal, and combine income over many periods.

To estimate a comprehensive measure of capital gains, we use a three step procedure: (i) link individuals to their specific portfolio holdings (ii) capitalize income (using heterogenoeus capitalization factors when available) to estimate wealth (iii) estimate capital appreciation by multiplying wealth by asset class specific returns (using heterogeneous returns when available). 

We do so by exploiting never before used tax forms, new data sources, and improved estimation techniques to provide the most accurate available measures of wealth and capital gains at the individual level. We highlight three innovations here: (i) we use techniques from the network economic literature to better track partnership wealth through network chains of ownership, which allows us to trace 90% of partnership assets to their ultimate owners (ii) we use never before used tax form to link 100% of rental real estate assets to their ultimate owner, which allows for a more accurate estimate of real estate wealth and capital gains (iii) we use a new data source on private business sales to better estimate business valuations and capital gains. 

We find that
